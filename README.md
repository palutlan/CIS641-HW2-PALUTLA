- I am an avid gamer who loves online first-person shooters and battle royales. I absolutely love building PCs and love to keep myself updated about the latest in tech.
- I am a Mobile application developer with 6+ years of experience building native iOS applications.
- When not gaming or developing an app you can find me watching motorsports like Formula 1 and IndyCar.
