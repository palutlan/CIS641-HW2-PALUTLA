# Sai Palutla

- Avid gamer who loves online first-person shooters and battle royales. I absolutely love building PCs and love to keep myself updated about the latest in tech.
- Mobile application developer with 6+ years of experience building native iOS applications.
- When not gaming or developing an app you can find me watching motorsports like Formula 1 and IndyCar.

## Technical Background

I am an iOS developer proficient in Objective-C and Swift and have published more than 10 apps on the AppStore. I personally believe that to be a successful business you need to have a great mobile app. I have also used cross-platform tools like React Native and Kony to develop apps for Android and iOS.
